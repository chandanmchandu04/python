1. **02_basics.py**  
   This script demonstrates:
   - Loop operations with `for` and `while`.
   - Use of `continue` and `break` statements to control loop execution.
   - Conditional statements to compare values and output results.  
   Example highlights:
     - Skipping a specific element ("virat") in a list.
     - Breaking a loop when a specific condition is met.
     - Using a `while` loop with conditional logic.

2. **basics.py**  
   This script includes:
   - Iterating over lists and ranges.
   - Nesting loops for deeper iteration.
   - Exploring data types within loops.  
   Example highlights:
     - Printing all numbers in a list and their types.
     - Nested iteration over ranges.
     - Handling a list of strings.
